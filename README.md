# Birthday Countdown Clock
Just a little joke repo ;) 

We were building tiny JavaScript clocks to practice JS fundamentals. [Nina Mutty](https://www.github.com/ninamutty) built a little Christmas countdown clock, and I forked it and turned it into a birthday clock for me and [Briana Eng](https://www.github.com/brianaeng). I deployed it on Heroku but have since taken it down, because our birthday has passed.
